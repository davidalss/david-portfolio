# Clean Code Principles I Live By

Writing clean, maintainable code is a skill that develops over time. Here are the principles that guide my development work.

## 1. Meaningful Names

Variables, functions, and classes should clearly communicate their purpose:

```javascript
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const x = calculateTotal(items);

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const orderTotal = calculateTotal(items);
```

## 2. Functions Should Do One Thing

Keep functions focused and single-purpose:

```javascript
// Bad
function processUserAndSendEmail(user) {
  validateUser(user);
  saveToDatabase(user);
  sendWelcomeEmail(user);
}

// Good
function processUser(user) {
  validateUser(user);
  saveToDatabase(user);
}

function sendWelcomeEmail(user) {
  // Email logic here
}
```

## 3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Avoid code duplication by extracting common logic into reusable functions.

## 4. Comments Explain Why, Not What

Code should be self-explanatory. Comments should explain the reasoning behind decisions:

```javascript
// Bad
// Increment counter
counter++;

// Good
// Skip the first item as it's a header row
counter++;
```

## 5. Error Handling

Always handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

## Conclusion

Clean code is about respect - for your future self and for other developers who will work with your code. These principles have made my code more maintainable and easier to debug.
